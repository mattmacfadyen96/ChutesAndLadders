# ChutesAndLadders
# Brief Description of this Project
This is a text based version of Chutes and Ladders. It will simulate a specific amount of game simulations and then collect data based on those games. Data collected: Most landed on space in all of the games, number of spins it took to finish, the average number of ladders that were landed on and the average number of chutes landed on. 

# How to run this project 
In order to run this program you run the main method in the Driver class. This will start the simulations and start collecting the data associated with each of the trials. After the end of each group of simulations it will print out the results.
